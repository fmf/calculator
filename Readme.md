Disclaimer
----------
	* This program is supposed to be my project for the highschool
	(useless) certificate. (god this makes no sense to outsiders
	(pentru romani: asta e atestatul meu)).
	* The code is (at it's best) crap. "Then why use our server space
	asshole?", "Good question. Let's see. Mainly because nothing is useless,
	it can (and I hope it will) serve as a bad example."
	* The compile script on gnu/linux has no failsaves whatsoever.
