Calculator program (or a bad clone at it)
=========================================

# Info
	* A calculator with basic and advanced (yeah, right) interfaces which can compute ecuations in infix format (like the ones used by 99.99% of the world) and postfix format (seriously, who the fuck uses this?).
	* works on unix-like and windows os. (requires gtk 2)
	
# Compile
	* On unix-like systems use the supplied script
	* On windows use (and pray):
		fpc main.pas -O2 -Xs -Cg -ocalculator

# Disclaimer
	* This program is supposed to be my project for the highschool (useless) certificate. (god this makes no sense to outsiders (pentru romani: asta e atestatul meu)).
	* The code is (at it's best) crap. "Then why use our server space asshole?", "Good question. Let's see. Mainly because nothing is useless, it can (and I hope it will) serve as a bad example."
	* The compile script on gnu/linux has no failsaves whatsoever.
